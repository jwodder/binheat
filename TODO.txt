- Add an option for appending values found in the input but not in the -1/-2
  files to the output
- Use ISOLatin1Encoding
 - Obviously, this will involve all input being converted to Latin-1 for
   output.  If possible, input characters outside of the Latin-1 range should
   be converted to the Latin-1 characters corresponding to the bytes of their
   UTF-8 encoding (e.g., "α" becomes "Î±"); if this isn't possible, non-Latin-1
   input characters should be a fatal error.
- Use accurate widths for the row/column labels
 - Have binheat.pl construct a short PostScript program that calculates the
   maximum lengths of the row labels & column labels in the given font and
   outputs them, then pipe this program through a PostScript instance before
   outputting any of the actual PostScript output so that proper dimensions for
   the main output can be calculated.
 - The program through which binheat.pl pipes the intermediate program should
   be configurable, with an empty or undefined value causing it to revert back
   to guessing "length * em" for the widths.
 - Alternatively (or alongside the above, enabled by a switch?), binheat.pl
   could just use the "length * em" method for determining the dimensions of
   the EPS file, and then said file could go through the calculations itself to
   properly typeset everything in the center of the page.
- Improve handling of empty fields
 - Currently, binheat.pl will ignore a line of the form "label<TAB><EOL>" but
   will treat a line of the form "<TAB>label<EOL>" as denoting a relationship
   from an empty label to "label".  Either eliminate the latter behavior or
   treat lines with a single label as just establishing that the label exists
   (meaningful only when -S is in effect).
- Add an option for setting the font?
- Add an option for emitting a warning when a field not in a supplied -1/-2
  file is encountered
- Support comments at the end of nonempty lines?
